Dear Students and parents,<br /><br />

This post is to inform you that the prices on some of our lunches have made an increase.  This is NOT our doing.  The increase has come from our establishments where we purchase the lunches.  We've had to increase to cover the payment prices.  We have figured very close to cover the prices, yet still be able to offer your children lunches.  Your children are more than welcome to bring a lunch from home if they would like.  We want to help keep everyone happy.  We are sending home a new food list with new prices, along with updating the website to refelect these changes. If you have any questions please feel free to give us a call or come by the school office. Thanks for your kind consideration.<br />

This will become effecitve on Tuesday, January 31, 2023.<br />

In His Service,<br /><br />
