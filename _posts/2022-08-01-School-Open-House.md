Dear Parents, Guardians & Students,

Open house this year will be held August 12th, 2022 at 7pm. We encourage you all to be there as we will be going over dress code, rules, lunch schedule, and other important information to make sure the year runs as smoothly as possible. This will also be the oportunity for your child(ren) to find out who their teacher, classmates and learning center will be. We will also have copies of this years application to fill out to make sure the office has the most up to date contact information for all parents and guardians.

If you have any questions please contact the school office at <a href="tel:+17724611225">1-772-461-1225</a> extension 1.<br /><br />
