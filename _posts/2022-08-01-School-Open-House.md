Dear Parents, Guardians & Students,

Open house this year will be held August 12th, 2022 at 7pm. We encourage you all to be there as we will be going over changes to the dress code, rules, lunch schedule, and other important information to make sure the year runs as smoothly as possible. This will give the oportunity for your child(ren) to find out their Learning Center, as well as their teacher and classmates. We will also be providing copies of this year's application to fill out in order for the office to have the most up to date contact information for all parents and guardians.

If you have any questions please contact the school office at <a href="tel:+17724611225">1-772-461-1225</a> extension 1.<br /><br />
