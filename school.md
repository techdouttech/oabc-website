Orange Avenue Baptist School offers opportunities for spiritual, educational, social, and physical development. We encourage you to become involved in your child’s development by attending all school activities and functions, participating in your child’s special Learning Center events, and praying daily for the staff and administration. We trust that the Lord will enable us to provide the best education possible for your child.
